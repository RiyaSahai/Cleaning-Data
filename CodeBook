This file is a codebook that gives a description about the variables, data and functions used in the run_analysis.R script.

source data : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
This was downloaded and unzipped into R. 

All required files were read as tables into:

xtest: reads the X_test file in the test folder of the data.
xtrain: reads the X_train file in the test folder of the data.
ytest: reads the y_test file in the test folder of the data.
ytrain: reads the y_train file in the test folder of the data.
features: reads the features.txt file to get all the column names for our data.
activities: reads the activity_labels.txt file to get the activities for which the data was measured.
subte: reads subject test data
subtr: reads subject train data

ans -  dataset containing test and train data for X
subf - dataset containing subject data
yf - dataset containing final test and train data for y
ansf - dataset containing all of the merged data of y, subject and x
df - final data including activity

x - column names containing "mean" in the final set
y - column names containing "sd" in the final set
x1- data frame of x
y1- data frame of y
z- combined data frame of x1 and y1
final - dataset containing mean and sd measuerments from initial merged dataset

data - dataset containing mean of each subject and each activity
